"""SQLite-backed :class:`ApprovalStore` for gateway command approvals.

Stores proposals in a dedicated ``gateway_approvals`` table inside the
existing Hermes ``state.db`` (default ``~/.hermes/state.db``). The table
is self-contained: it is created idempotently via
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` on every store instantiation, with no
coupling to :data:`hermes_state.SCHEMA_VERSION`. That keeps approval-
storage migrations decoupled from session/message-schema bumps.

Atomicity model
---------------

Every state transition uses an **explicit short transaction** with
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` so the writer lock is taken before any read happens.
That, combined with ``UPDATE ... WHERE status='pending' ... RETURNING``,
gives us a true compare-and-set with no TOCTOU window.

Consume / deny semantics:

  - Returns ``None`` if there is no matching row (missing / wrong status /
    expired). The UPDATE simply matches zero rows; the transaction
    commits a no-op. No exception is raised — fail closed, not fail loud.
  - Two concurrent consumers (same process, different threads, or
    different processes entirely) serialise on the SQLite file lock.
    Exactly one's UPDATE matches a pending row; the other matches zero.

Payload model
-------------

The :class:`ApprovalProposal` is serialised verbatim to ``payload_json``
**at submit time** and is never rewritten. Lifecycle columns
(``status``, ``consumed_at``, ``consumed_by``) hold the current FSM
state. On read we deserialise the original payload and overlay the
current lifecycle state — that preserves the pinned-policy invariant
because the payload itself is immutable post-submit.

Connection lifecycle
--------------------

A new ``sqlite3.Connection`` is opened per operation. SQLite handles
file-level locking; WAL allows concurrent readers with a single writer.
For the gateway's approval rate (rare events) the per-operation
connection cost is dominated by the work itself.

NFS / SMB caveat
----------------

SQLite over NFS/SMB has documented locking quirks. ``apply_wal_with_fallback``
(from :mod:`hermes_state`) is reused so the same fallback to journal_mode=
DELETE applies if WAL is unsupported.
